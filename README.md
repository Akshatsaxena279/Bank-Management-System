# Bank-Management-System
A Python-Tkinter based Bank Management System with MySQL integration. It supports account creation, deposits, withdrawals, closures (with trigger-based logging), and transaction viewing. Includes a GUI to display table data (master, trans, account_closed) without using MySQL directly.
